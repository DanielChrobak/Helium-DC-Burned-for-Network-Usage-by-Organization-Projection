# Helium-DC-Burned-for-Network-Usage-by-Organization-Projection

Algorithm Summary
This comprehensive time series forecasting system implements a sophisticated multi-component approach:

Key Components:
Outlier Detection: Uses IQR, Modified Z-Score, and seasonal methods to identify and handle anomalous data points

Robust Regression: Implements Huber regression for trend estimation that's resistant to outliers

Seasonal Decomposition: Captures day-of-week, monthly, quarterly, and holiday effects

Context-Aware Modeling: Fits separate autoregressive models for different temporal contexts (weekdays, weekends, holidays, etc.)

Bootstrap Sampling: Uses block bootstrap to generate realistic forecast uncertainty

Walk-Forward Validation: Rigorously tests forecast performance using time series cross-validation

Forecasting Process:
Decompose the time series into trend + seasonal + residual components

Model each component separately using appropriate statistical methods

Combine all components with stochastic innovations for future projections

Validate performance using multiple accuracy metrics

This algorithm is particularly effective for business data with complex seasonal patterns, outliers, and varying behavior across different time contexts.
