# Helium-DC-Burned-for-Network-Usage-by-Organization-Projection

## Algorithm Summary

This comprehensive time series forecasting system implements a sophisticated multi-component approach:

### Key Components:
1. Outlier Detection: Uses IQR, Modified Z-Score, and seasonal methods to identify and handle anomalous data points

2. Robust Regression: Implements Huber regression for trend estimation that's resistant to outliers

3. Seasonal Decomposition: Captures day-of-week, monthly, quarterly, and holiday effects

4. Context-Aware Modeling: Fits separate autoregressive models for different temporal contexts (weekdays, weekends, holidays, etc.)

5. Bootstrap Sampling: Uses block bootstrap to generate realistic forecast uncertainty

6. Walk-Forward Validation: Rigorously tests forecast performance using time series cross-validation

### Forecasting Process:
1. Decompose the time series into trend + seasonal + residual components

2. Model each component separately using appropriate statistical methods

3. Combine all components with stochastic innovations for future projections

4. Validate performance using multiple accuracy metrics

This algorithm is particularly effective for business data with complex seasonal patterns, outliers, and varying behavior across different time contexts.
